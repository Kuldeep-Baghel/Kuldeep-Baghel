### Quantitative Finance | Systematic Trading Research | Python

I am building my profile in quantitative finance with a focus on **systematic thinking, market behavior, and data-driven analysis**.  
My primary interest lies in understanding how trading ideas can be translated into **rule-based strategies** and evaluated objectively using historical data and risk-aware metrics.

I approach markets through structured research rather than discretionary decision-making, emphasizing clarity of logic, robustness of assumptions, and continuous learning.

## What I Work On

- Quantitative trading strategy research and backtesting  
- Python-based systems for signal generation, performance evaluation, and risk analysis  
- Studying market behavior across different regimes, with attention to drawdowns and consistency  
- Exploring derivatives, volatility, and portfolio-level dynamics  

---

## Technical Focus

- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- **Quant Concepts:** Backtesting, performance analytics, drawdowns, risk-adjusted metrics  
- **Markets:** Equities and derivatives (futures, options)  
- **Approach:** Modular systems, clean logic, and realistic assumptions

## Work in Progress

I am currently reviewing and refining my repositories to ensure they reflect **clean, working implementations** and my current understanding.  
Only selected projects are kept public, while others are consolidated privately as part of ongoing learning and system improvement.

*I am focused on steadily building depth in quantitative research, markets, and implementation through hands-on work and disciplined iteration.*
